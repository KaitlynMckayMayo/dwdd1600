            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>What are the essential tools I need to start baking?</dt>
                <dd>Common baking essentials include measuring cups and spoons, mixing bowls, a whisk, a set of baking pans, parchment paper, and a reliable oven thermometer. Additional items, like a stand mixer or pastry brush, can be added as you progress.</dd>
                <dt>Can I double a baking recipe, or will it affect the results?</dt>
                <dd>Doubling recipes can work for some baked goods but can be tricky for others, like cakes and cookies, where proportions are key. Consider baking in batches, especially for items that are sensitive to ingredient ratios, or adjust baking times accordingly if doubling.</dd>
                <dt>How can I tell when my cake is done baking?</dt>
                <dd>Cakes are usually done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, or when the top springs back lightly to the touch. Checking these visual cues helps prevent overbaking or underbaking.</dd>
